		<strong>PREAMBLE</strong>
		<br>
	<p>	
		The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of abstraction. The clauses that are included in the full version give examples and details of how tehese aspirations change the way we act as software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic and tedious; without the details, the aspirations can become high-sounding but empty; together the aspirations and the details from a cohesive code.
